                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    Margin trading involves considerable risk and is not suitable for every investor. See for details on risks. Although online trading brings a lot of convenience or efficiency to customers, it does not reduce the risk of margin trading itself. Therefore, customers must be prepared to bear this risk before trading.

                <p class='text'>
                    5. Password protection
                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    Clients must keep their passwords confidential to ensure that no third parties have access to their trading facilities. The customer agrees that the instructions sent to CATS via email, electronic trading platform, and SMS are indeed responsible, even if they are issued by a third party. These instructions have been authenticated with the customer's password or customer signature and account number. According to CATS' judgment, it is believed to be the surface authorization of the customer. CATS is not obligated to make further inquiries into this prima facie authority, nor is it responsible for the consequences of actions taken or not taken pursuant to these prima facie authorities. The customer is solely responsible for the confidentiality, security and use of the password.

                <p class='text'>
                    CATS is not responsible for the corresponding error in the account balance if there is an error in the quotation or transaction price. Relevant errors may include, but are not limited to: wrong quotations by traders, quotations of non-international market prices, or any quotation errors (such as quotation errors due to hardware, software or communication lines or system failures or third parties providing wrong external data data). CATS is not responsible for losses caused by quoting errors.

                    7. Manipulating prices
                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    CATS absolutely prohibits any form of manipulation of its prices, execution and platform. If any account is suspected of being manipulated, CATS reserves the right to investigate and audit the account, and deduct the profits earned from the relevant activities from the suspected account.

                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    CATS only endeavors to trade with reputable and reliable institutions and clearinghouses. In addition, CATS may stop trading due to trading liquidity problems, so that customers cannot close the loss-making positions in time, which may cause considerable losses to customers. CATS will not be liable for these losses.

                <p class='text'>
                    9. Margin policy
                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    CATS' margin policy may require clients to provide additional funds in order to maintain their margin accounts and it is the client's obligation to meet such margin requirements. Otherwise, the position may be automatically closed and cause corresponding losses.
                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    10. Third Party Management Transaction Authorization
                </p>
                <p class='text'>
                    CATS is not responsible for the choices made by the client if the client delegates the authorization to trade or the management of his account to a third party, whether voluntarily or not. CATS does not make any representations or guarantees to third parties related to transactions; CATS is not responsible for losses incurred by customers due to the actions of third parties in transactions.
